Introduction
======
I am a PHD student at [Robotics Institute](http://robot.hit.edu.cn/), [Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT)](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) advised by [Weidong Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wangweidong). Now I am studying with [Ji Zhang](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~zhangji/) in Robotics Institute, [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) as a visiting scholar. My recent research is focusing on robot navigation, autonomous exploration and source localization.
