[Autonomous Exploration Development Environment](https://github.com/HongbiaoZ/autonomous_exploration_development_environment)
* The repository is meant for leveraging system development and robot deployment for ground-based autonomous navigation and exploration. Containing a variety of simulation environments, autonomous navigation modules such as collision avoidance, terrain traversability analysis, path following, etc, and a set of visualization tools, users can develop autonomous navigation systems and later on port those systems onto real robots for deployment.

[Dual Stage Viewpoint Planner](https://github.com/HongbiaoZ/dynamic_rrt_based_exploration_planner)
* A dynamic RRT based dual stage planner is developed in this repository to explore unknown environments efficiently and completely. The planner involves two stages - a local plan stage for exploration and extension of the map and a global plan stage for relocation of the vehicle between different mapped areas. During the course of a deployment, the method transitions back-and-forth between the two stages extending the map in all possible directions. Both the local plan and global plan are dynamically maintained through the re-planning circles.
* Open-source code will be available soon.
